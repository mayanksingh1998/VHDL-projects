2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net XLXI_134/XLXN_312 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin XLXI_134/XLXI_89/O, cell XLXI_134/XLXI_89. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net XLXI_134/XLXN_313 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin XLXI_134/XLXI_90/O, cell XLXI_134/XLXI_90. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net XLXI_134/XLXN_314 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin XLXI_134/XLXI_91/O, cell XLXI_134/XLXI_91. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

Gated clock check  
Net XLXI_134/XLXN_318 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin XLXI_134/XLXI_95/O, cell XLXI_134/XLXI_95. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#8 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net XLXI_134/XLXN_319 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin XLXI_134/XLXI_96/O, cell XLXI_134/XLXI_96. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
